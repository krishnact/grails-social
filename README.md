# grails-social
 This app implements social login in Grails app.

It does not follow workflow implemented in Grails Oatuh2 plugin. It cuts short 
the 'ask to crete or link'. It just goes ahead and creates an account, 
because not many people want to create an account nowadays. Because of this it is
not possible to have multiple social logins for the same user using this app. One can always 
go and munge the database to do so.
